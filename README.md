# Rare Risk Variants at GWAS Loci

An individual with a family history of multiple myeloma is four times as likely to develop the disease, yet the inherited susceptibility is only partially understood. Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified common variants that mark genomic locations important for myeloma risk; however, the target genes and the particular functional changes underlying these signals remain largely unknown.  
 
In Waller et al. (2021) we are the first to investigate potentially functional rare risk variants at known susceptibility loci proposed in blood cancer GWAS. Our findings implicate six genes in myeloma risk, provide support for a shared genetic etiology across lymphoid neoplasm subtypes, and demonstrate the utility of sequencing genetically enriched cases to identify functional variants at GWAS loci.

Here we provide the code and variants (VCF) that generated the Discovery, Replication, and Extension phase results reported in Waller et al. (2021).
